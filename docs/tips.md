To convert the provided SVG code into the desired format, we need to first understand what the desired format represents. The format appears to be an HTML `img` tag that links to an SVG icon hosted on GitHub. However, the task here is to convert the given SVG code into a similar format but for a different icon.

Given the SVG code is for a specific icon, and you want it in a format similar to the one you provided, which is essentially an `img` tag linking to an SVG file, we can't directly "convert" the SVG code into that format without hosting the SVG somewhere and then linking to it. However, we can guide you on how to achieve a similar outcome.

### Step 1: Identify the Icon
First, identify what the SVG code represents. Since the code is provided but not its visual representation, let's assume it's an icon for a specific technology or application, similar to how the example you provided is for MySQL.

### Step 2: Hosting the SVG
To use the SVG in the same way as the MySQL icon, you would need to host the SVG file somewhere accessible via a URL. This could be on your own server, a CDN, or a repository like GitHub.

1. ***Save the SVG Code as a File***: Copy the SVG code into a text editor and save it with a `.svg` extension, for example, `myicon.svg`.
2. ***Host the File***: Upload this file to your hosting platform. For GitHub, you would create a repository, upload the file, and note the URL to the raw SVG file.
### Step 3: Creating the img Tag
Once you have the URL to your hosted SVG file, you can create an img tag similar to the MySQL example you provided.

Let's say you hosted your SVG at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepository/master/icons/myicon.svg`. Your `img` tag would look like this:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepository/master/icons/myicon.svg" alt="My Icon" width="20" height="20"/>
```

Replace `yourusername`, `yourrepository`, and `myicon.svg` with the actual values from your hosted SVG file's URL.

### Conclusion
While we can't directly "convert" the SVG code into an `img` tag linking to a hosted SVG without actually hosting the file, the steps above outline how to achieve the desired outcome. This involves saving the SVG code as a file, hosting it somewhere accessible, and then creating an `img` tag that links to the hosted SVG file.
